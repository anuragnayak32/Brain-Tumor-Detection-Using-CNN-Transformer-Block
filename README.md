# Brain-Tumor-Detection-Using-CNN-Transformer-Block

📌 Overview
-> This project focuses on detecting brain tumors from MRI scans using a hybrid deep learning architecture that combines Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Transformer-based models. CNNs are used for feature extraction, while Transformers help capture long-range dependencies and contextual information in the images, improving classification accuracy.

🎯 Objective
-> To build an automated system that can accurately classify MRI brain images into tumor and non-tumor categories, aiding radiologists and healthcare professionals in early diagnosis and treatment planning.

🗂️ Dataset
-> The dataset consists of brain MRI images categorized into tumor and non-tumor classes.
-> Images are preprocessed by resizing, normalizing pixel values, and applying data augmentation techniques like     rotation and fliping.
-> Dataset Source:- 
-> Number of images:- 10000
-> Classes:- Tumor, No-Tumor 

⚙️ Technologies Used
-> This project is built using Python programming language.
-> Deep learning frameworks used are TensorFlow or PyTorch.
-> Other libraries include OpenCV for image processing and NumPy, Pandas for data handling.
-> Matplotlib and Seaborn are used for visualizations.
